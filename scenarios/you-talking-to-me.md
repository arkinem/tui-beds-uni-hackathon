> Personalised digital signage that only shows adverts relevent to those passing by

TUI customers in a resort represent a wide cross-section of society, as such the marketing team feel their in-resort adverts would have a greater level of success if they were personlised to the individual / group looking at them.

A few scenarios that they have suggested are:
- John walks past the signage, the signage recognises John, and knows that for the last 3 days he has booked a thrill-seeking excursion. The signage then displays an advert tailored to John - `Hi John! Looking for adventure?! How about bungee jumping over the canyon tomorrow? Spaces are limited!`
- An unknown couple of similar age walk past the signage. The signage displays the advert: `The premier restaurant is the perfect place to relax with a glass of a wine and great company!`
- A family with children walk past the signage, instead of showing an advert, the signage instead shows the camera feed of the family, but superimposes TUI hats on everyone's heads
- Large group of people walk past the signage at the same time, 70% of the group are carrying towels, the advert displayed says `Can't find a sunbed? Try hiring one from the beach hut, tan guaranteed or your money back!`

You have been requested to implement the digital signage with one or more scenarios or any others that you think would work.
